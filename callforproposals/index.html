                            <h3> Proposal Types </h3>
                            <br/>
                            In addition to selecting which topic your submission best fits into, please also let us know what type of presentation you will share. Provided below is the list of submission types:
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <h4> Full Length Presentations </h4>
                            Presentation sessions focus on your experience with topics such as user experience research methods, philosophy, business case studies, or other relevant topics. Speakers should plan ample time for innovative audience participation within the 60-minute time allocation. That means don’t just do a Q&A – get the audience to interact with each other and with you! 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <h4> Panels </h4>
                            Panels cover the same areas of interest as presentations and consist of 3-5 experts in the topic at hand. Each person should have a different view point in order to facilitate a well-rounded discussion. Submissions should include a short, anonymous position statement from each potential panelist.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <h4> Pre-Conference Courses </h4>
                            These courses allow attendees to extend their knowledge with half-day and full-day sessions led by experienced and skilled UX professionals. These courses are classroom-style sessions, where instructors teach attendees specific user experience knowledge or skills. Courses will include presentations covering in-depth explorations of a topic, as well as discussions and activities to allow attendees to share and practice their new skills. 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <h4> Posters </h4>
                            These are a way to present research results, new ideas or concepts in an informal, visual, and interactive manner. Presenting is very informal – there will be a 60-minute time slot during which you will become the docent to your poster and present the information to those who come to listen.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            When creating your poster, make sure to include what you did, why, how, and what you’ve learned. It’s often helpful for submitters to include an image depicting the planned layout of the poster. There is no template for the poster design – so be creative!
                            <br/> <br/>
                            You will be responsible for printing your own poster and getting it to the conference location. Posters will be displayed starting the first full day of the conference. And remember, posters are a great way to start presenting at conferences! 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <strong> Poster Dimensions </strong>
                            <ul> 
                                <li> US Standard size: 24” x 36” </li>
                                <li> ISO Standard size: Size A1 - 59.4 x 84.1 cm </li>
                            </ul>
                            We highly recommend all posters are printed on foam core so they will stand up on the easels.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <h4> Collaboration Sessions </h4>
                            Collaboration sessions provide a forum for experienced practitioners to do a “deep dive” into a topic of interest during a half-day session. The leader acts as a facilitator or moderator of an advanced brainstorming session among colleagues, in which all attendees are expected to present examples and participate actively in the discussion.
                            <br/> <br/> <br/>
                            Before the conference, any interested attendees are required to submit a position paper describing their background in the topic and providing input to the discussion, such as case studies or lessons learned from their work relevant to the topic. Some sessions require additional pre-conference work, such as completing a survey, preparing a demo, or collecting and sharing examples for discussion with the group. 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            The leader selects attendees based on their position papers and their depth of experience with the topic. The leader is expected to summarize the position papers, plan activities for the session in advance, facilitate the session at the conference, and write an article for UX Magazine or JUS to describe the outcomes of the session.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            We are looking for topics of interest to experienced practitioners and managers of UX teams. Examples include: design standards for enterprise applications, voice interfaces or adaptive systems; integrating UX in a software development lifecycle; nurturing skill development in a UX team; managing a consultancy or an in-house design team; and pros and cons of different tools or methods for research or design.

                            <h4> Selection criteria </h4>
                            We need presenters who have a diverse level of knowledge, experience, and qualifications. We are striving to create a balanced experience during this conference and will give every speaker the chance to provide their point of view. 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            Selection criteria is based on the quality of your proposal, but also based on the alignment with the overall experience we want to create during UXPA 2017. We want to ensure the conference entertains and enlightens our attendees.
